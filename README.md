# Discord-Mirror
An educational purpose only project, that allows you to mirror discord via a user. Do not use it for incorrect purposes, you will not comply with Discord's terms and services.

This is an old project (maybe it doesn't work today) I made that allows discord mirroring by a user. I recommend not using the account you use every day but a trial one.

You can edit it and make it better than it is. It is possible with a little work to customize the embeds to your liking.

The reference documentation for this project is as follows: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway
